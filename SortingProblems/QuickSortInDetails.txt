1)=> QuickSort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort elements by selecting a "pivot" element and then organizing other elements into two sub-arrays: one with elements less than the pivot and one with elements greater than the pivot.

Choose a Pivot: Pick an element from the array. This can be any element, but common choices include the first element, last element, or a random element.

Partition the Array: Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot are to its left, and all elements greater than the pivot are to its right.

Recursively Sort Sub-arrays: Apply the same process (choose pivot, partition) to the left and right sub-arrays.

Combine: Once the left and right parts are sorted, combine them. Since the partitioning already placed the pivot in its correct position, there's no need for any merging.
