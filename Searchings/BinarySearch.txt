   *****************************Binary Search Explained Simply************************
Binary search is a super-fast way to find an item in a sorted list. Instead of checking every single item one by one (like flipping through every page of a dictionary), binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search area in half, making it much more efficient.


********************************How Binary Search Works (Step-by-Step)*********************

1.Start with a sorted list (e.g., numbers in order, names alphabetically).

2.Find the middle element and compare it with your target.

3.If it matches, you found it!

4.If your target is smaller, ignore the right half and repeat on the left.

5.If your target is larger, ignore the left half and repeat on the right.

6.Repeat until you find the item or confirm it’s not there.



***********************************Example*********************

Imagine you’re looking for the word "Moon" in a dictionary:

You open the dictionary in the middle—you see the word "Lion."

Since "Moon" comes after "Lion," you ignore the first half and focus on the right half.

Now, check the middle of the remaining pages—you see "Rabbit."

"Moon" comes before "Rabbit," so now you ignore the right half and search between "Lion" and "Rabbit."

You keep doing this until you find "Moon" (or realize it’s not there).

This is way faster than flipping every single page!

***************Note
Why Binary Search is Awesome
Very fast! For a list of 1,000,000 items, it takes at most 20 steps (compared to 1,000,000 steps in a linear search).

Only works on sorted data (if unsorted, you must sort it first)
